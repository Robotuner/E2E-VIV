    <h1>About E2E-VIV</h1>
    <p>
        The initiative is created by Leonard Kong, an independent software developer to provide an alternative to
        mail-in voting. Mail-in voting has garnered much support because it touts accessibility. The problem is
        that it exposes countless opportunities for fraud to solve a problem that benefits a relative small
        percentage of voters. The RNC response appears to be one of damage control instead of addressing the
        issue with a better solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Internet voting is a better solution. The question is no longer if internet voting is more secure than
        in-person voting, it is if <strong>internet voting can be made more secure that mail-in voting</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This site seeks to develop verifiable open source code that can be reviewed and tested by the
        community at large. The internet is full of organizations that simply state
        <strong><a href="https://verifiedvoting">internet voting is not secure</a></strong>, which may
        ultimately prove correct, but I don't know that. The sites only make the statement as an accepted truth. 
        They do not back it up with code to demonstrate where or how it is insecure.</p>
    <p> 
        This site makes an argument that it is <strong>more secure than mail-in voting</strong> and backs it up with 
        an open source prototype code that can be scrutinized so that those sections found to be 
        vulnerable can be made secure in a systematic manner.  This is the only way that I see 
        internet voting can progress towards certification.        
    </p>

        Currently, this is a one person endeavor, I welcome all who can contribute.  E2E is end to end, the 
        knowledge set for a complete demonstration site will require the full range of technical competencies.  I 
        will need help with web servers, database server, UI (web and mobile), facial recognition, documentation, 
        most of all hackers. The project touches everything.
